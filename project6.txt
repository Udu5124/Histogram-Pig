Project Description
You are asked to implement Project 1 (histogram of pixels) using Apache Pig. Your Pig script should read an input pixel file as in Project 1. The data files are exactly the same as in Project 1.

In your Pig script, you can access the path of the input pixels file as '$P' and the output path as '$O'. That is, you can use LOAD '$P' USING ..., to load the pixels and STORE X INTO '$O' ..., to write the relation X to the output directory.

To run it in local mode over the small pixels file use:

sbatch histogram.local.run
This will process the histogram on the small dataset pixels-small.txt and will write the result in the directory output. These results should be similar to the results in the file solution-small.txt. After you make sure that your program runs correctly in local mode, you run it in distributed mode using:
sbatch histogram.distr.run
This will process the histogram on the large dataset pixels-large.txt and will write the result in the directory output-distr. These results should be similar to the results in the file solution-large.txt.
